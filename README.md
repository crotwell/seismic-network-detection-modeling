# SeismicNetworkDetectionModeling
 Python codes to model the detection threshold of seismic networks using FilterPicker

EventFPPickerExample.py is for running and plotting event examples.
FilterPicker.py is the module that contains the various functions corresponding to the equations in Lomax et al., 2012.

For larger batch runs:
Step 1. Run makeFPparams to create a pickle file with input paramaters
Step 2. Run EventPicker_para.py (edit number of cores to run on in this file).
